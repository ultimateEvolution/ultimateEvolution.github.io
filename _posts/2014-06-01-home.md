# Welcome to the Ultimate Evolution website!

We are an Ultimate Frisbee Club based in Adelaide, South Australia playing and training in North Adelaide and the parklands around the CBD.
Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact team sport played with a Flying Disc aka Frisbee, suitable to all skill and fitness levels. It combines the quick passing of soccer and netball, the leaping marks of Aussie Rules and the diving catches of cricket as well as elements of touch football and grid-iron to create a fast paced, athletic sport.

Have a look around our website and, if you think you would like to give it a go, we would love to introduce you to the fun and excitement of both social and competitive Ultimate Frisbee!
